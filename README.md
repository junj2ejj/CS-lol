## Twitch (Comments)

According to [Official narrative](https://www.twitch.tv/p/zh-tw/legal/terms-of-service/) by Twitch

```
8. User Content
Twitch allows you to distribute streaming live and pre-recorded audio-visual works;
to use services, such as chat, bulletin boards, forum postings, wiki contributions, 
and voice interactive services; and to participate in other activities 
in which you may create, post, transmit, perform, or store content,
messages, text, sound, images, applications, code, or other data 
or materials on the Twitch Services (“User Content”).
```


Follow aforementioned terms, we conclude the use of user comments (chat while watching live-streaming) are license-free. Moreover, considering the process of constructing dataset takes time and different construction process might case results varies, we distribute the raw dataset used in this work.

## Youtube (Discriptions)

All of contents used in this dataset use subtitles that automatically generated by integrated ASR system in Youtube. However Youtube itself does not seems to have the license for those subtitles, as it is a kind of transformation of creation of other people, namely (impromptu) transcripts written by commentators.

Due to not sure about the license, alternatively we provide the script to download those subtitles as well as preprocessing script to transform it into the data expected using our implementation of retrieval models.
